Hey there!

This summer I'm gonna be [implementing encrypted search](http://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/xjCmlvMW) in Matrix, a project under the Matrix.org organization for the Google Summer of Code program. I'll be mentored by Charles Wright (aka [cvwright](http://github.com/cvwright)).

If you want to keep up with this project, you can join the public Matrix room [#encrypted-search:matrix.org](http://matrix.to/#/#encrypted-search:matrix.org). You can also subscribe to this blog's RSS feed.

On this blog I'll posting weekly updates about my progress with the project. I'll also be posting about interesting technical stuff I come across during my journey, whether it may be neat tricks or ugly bugs. I hope you'll accompany me on this journey.

See you next time!
